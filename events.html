         <div class="eventinfo">With 2018 now properly upon us, it's time for people to start planning the shows they're going to visit this year. To help you out, we've chosen five of the must-attend  car shows for 2018, based on what they have to offer, the general vibe of the events and, of course, the cars that you'll be able to see there. It was a difficult choice as there are so many events to choose from, but these five are the cream of the crop, and we'd highly recommend them to anyone interested in the car community.</div><br>
        <span class="eventTT">PLAYER CLASSIC</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="eventplace">When? June 23-24<br>Where?<button class="Locationbutton" onclick="on()">Goodwood Motor Circuit, West Sussex</button></span>
        <br>
    <img src="./photos/playersclassic.jpg" alt="playerclassic" >  <div class="eventinfo"><br>One of my personal favourite events of the year is held at the prestigious Goodwood Motor Circuit. The boys over at Players do a great job with this event; there’s such a great variety of cars on show from all over the world, while the all-day track action means the Players Classic is a great day out for all.
<br>
For 2018, the Players Classic show will be extending into a two-day event to give the spectators more of a chance to see what the expansive show has to offer. That also allows more all-important track time over the weekend – and more opportunity to see friends on the Saturday night in the surrounding hotels and bars!</div>

     <div class="mainevent">
        <span class="eventTT">Gravity Show</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="eventplace">When? July 15
<br>Where?<button class="Locationbutton" onclick="on()">Stoneleigh Park, Warwickshire</button></span>
        <br>
    <img src="./photos/gravityshow.jpg" alt="gravity" >  <div class="eventinfo"><br>Excuse me for blowing my own trumpet, but SlammedUK's very own Gravity Show has been dubbed by many as one of the best events to attend in the UK. Held at Stoneleigh Park in Coventry, Gravity is a one-day event and houses more than 500 show cars, 50 traders and a whole bunch of entertainment for all the family to enjoy.<br>

What I think makes Gravity Show stand out amongst some of the other events that the UK has to offer is the layout, organisation and variety of the show. With both indoor and outdoor show space, it’s perfect for the temperamental English weather and allows for a different standard of car in each area, as well as various different backdrops for photos and videos.<br>

Gravity Show is a great event for all of the family to attend. Whether you’re into show cars, wheels, race cars, classics, bikes or supercars, you’ll be able to find something to interest you. The show is situated almost slap bang in the middle of the UK, so it's in a great location for people travelling from every corner of the country. We even had cars travelling from as far as Sweden and Norway for our 2017 event, so it’s definitely a show not to miss!</div>

        <div class="mainevent">
        <span class="eventTT">Fitted UK</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="eventplace">When? July 29
<br>Where?<button class="Locationbutton" onclick="on()">EventCity, Manchester</button></span>
        <br>
    <img src="./photos/fitteduk.jpg" alt="Fitteduk" >  <div class="eventinfo"><br>FittedUK is one of the UK's largest indoor automotive events. Held at Manchester’s EventCity, the venue boasts over 300,000 square feet of open show space – filled each year by Europe’s best cars and bikes. The standard of car throughout FittedUK is very high, with everything from race cars to bikes and supercars, with some of the more special cars up on their own raised platforms dotted around the show.<br>

As well as the huge indoor space at the show, there is a big outside area where you can find all of the UK’s best club stands. There might even be some sunshine for the punters to enjoy!</div>
        </div>
     <div class="mainevent">
        <span class="eventTT">Ultimate Stance</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="eventplace">When? November 4
<br>Where?<button class="Locationbutton" onclick="on()">Telford International Centre, Telford</button></span>
        <br>
    <img src="./photos/ultimatestance.jpg" alt="ultimatestance" >  <div class="eventinfo"><br>Ultimate Stance is known all around the country as the ‘Show Season Finisher’ – especially as it’s run by the same guys that run the ‘Show Season Opener’, Ultimate Dubs! With a local bar and club, the Saturday night becomes the final party of the year for all the UK’s show-goers where everyone can meet up and have a drink before the season comes to a close.<br>

The show is spread over three indoor halls and a large outdoor area, and is home to the Europe’s best stance cars, no matter the make or model. In one hall, you’ll find cars fitted with the rarest and most sought-after wheels, as well as some of the coolest retro rides around.<br>

The great thing about Ultimate Stance is that you’ll always find a couple of cars that you’ve not seen the whole show season, as they’ve been being built and have only just made it to the final show of the year. It’s always good to see something different and because of that, Ultimate Stance is a great way to end the year.

        <br>
    <img src="./photos/trax.jpg" alt="trax" >  <div class="eventinfo"><br>One of the largest performance car events in the UK, with around 20,000 attendees over the weekend, TRAX is a show for the motorsport fans especially, with a huge 'Show and Shine' section for the show cars organised by the guys over at Fast Car Magazine. 
<br>
TRAX is held at the legendary Silverstone Circuit and has many famous faces and cars attending the event and racing around the track all weekend. And if you fancy yourself as a bit of a racer, you can also book onto the public track time sessions during the event, as well as being able to watch the professionals throughout the day.</div>
